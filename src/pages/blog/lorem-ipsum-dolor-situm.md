I've been a volunteer coordinator at 1 Million Cups since February 2017. I started attending 1 Million Cups when I first moved to Dallas at the end of last year.

I started attending 1 Million Cups because I had just moved to the Dallas area, and at the same time, had just started Bison Studio. 1 Million Cups was a great way to learn about a lot of different startup business models, and learn from entrepreneurs that have been in business for themselves for years.
<h2>One thing I learned when I first started</h2>
Is that the best start up pitches are the ones where the audience learns how to be a better business from you. What I mean by that is, your pitch is about your business more than it is about your product. A lot of people come into one million cups with a pitch to sell the audience on their product.

1 Million Cups can be helpful in getting practice on selling. But, that is not the point of the presentations. The point of the presentation is so that the community can get to know YOU more.

The best presentations, to me, were the ones where founders would go into detail on how they acquire customers, maintain relationships, produce their product, and distribute to customers. These are the kind of pitches that help the community, and when I gave my pitch I wanted to be ready to do that.
<h2>Preparation for the Pitch</h2>
8 Months later and I'm ready to give my pitch. Plus, <a href="http://wesvance.com">Wes</a> and I <a href="https://www.bisonstudio.co/blog/we-applied-for-sxsw">submitted at talk to SXSW</a> and I was hoping to get some more eyes on our submission during the voting period.

The stars aligned and I submitted an application to present to 1 Million Cups.
<h3>Slide Deck</h3>
I made the slide deck using <a href="http://slides.google.com">google slides</a>, easy enough
<h3>Practice</h3>
I practiced a total of 3 hours. I ran through the slides about 3 or 4 times, but I've told the story of Bison Studio at least 100 times to friends and fam
<h3>Anticipate questions</h3>
At 1 Million Cups there is always a 15 minute Q&amp;A. I try to anticipate at least 10 different questions that people would likely ask. Some questions I know people are always going to ask are
<ul>
 	<li>How much do you charge?</li>
 	<li>How do you find clients?</li>
 	<li>What are your plans for the business?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Follow Up</h3>
I wanted to make sure that the Bison Studio website was ready to take on as much traffic as possible from the event.

I spent roughly 2-3 weeks revamping the website and include some of Bison Studio's more recent portfolio. I also got an ssl certificate, so that attendees would see our lovely <code>https</code> url.

<strong>It is important to make sure that you have a follow up funnel in place for any public speaking that you do, so you can make the most of the traffic you're generating.Â </strong>

<h3>The Pitch</h3>
Get up in front of 75 people and talking about your business can be really exciting.

Unfortunately the only picture that someone snapped of me makes me look like I'm blowing a raspberry...

I am an example of terrible posture, from this photo. But the biggest key indicator of success is to show up.
<h2>Everyone can change the world.</h2>
The first half of Bison Studio's motto is that everyone can make a difference. If you're showing up and doing the work, you're already winning half the battle.

I am not the best at public speaking, but I got valuable feedback from pitching at 1 Million Cups, and I'll be more prepared the next time I pitch Bison Studio.
<h2>We can help.</h2>
The second half of Bison Studio's motto comes from my excitement to see people making a difference. That's why I attend 1 Million Cups. That's why Bison Studio makes products for startups.

I hope that the presentation helped entrepreneurs in Dallas that are starting their own journey.
