# Curiosity Apps Is...

a design, code, and consulting studio that specializes in creating products that live on the web. Bison Studio is owned and operated by Devan Huapaya. And usually operates with partner freelancers and agencies. The end results are engaging products built on partnerships with the users in mind.



Bison Studio specializes in building lean MVPs. That means we focus on the most important part of your users' experience and optimize around that. Everything else is fat that is cut out (of the first iteration) or whipped into shape.



We believe that web apps are the best apps. They work in the browser, which can already support your desktop and phone. Modern technology is at a point where web apps can be built to be published to the app store and Google Play.
